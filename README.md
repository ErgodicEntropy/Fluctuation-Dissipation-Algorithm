# Fluctuation-Dissipation-Algorithm
Introducing the Fluctuation-Dissipation algorithm! An optimization algorithm inspired from statistical physics notions such as the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution as well as H-theorem, and more precisely Fluctution-Dissipation theorem.This project is a tribute to the genius of Ludwig Boltzmann
